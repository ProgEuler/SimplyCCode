Write a program to find the sum of the first and last digits of a five digit number.

<h3>input :</h3>

The first input to the program will be an integer `T(1<=T<=10,000)`, which will indicate the total number of five-digit numbers to be input. next- `T` one integer per number of lines `N(10,000<=N<=99,999)` input is required.

<h3>output :</h3>

In the output of the program The sum of the first and last digits of should be printed in the same format as shown in the sample output below. A newline should be printed after each output. The space before and after the `=, -` in the output is noticeable.
